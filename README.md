# Assignment: Timetables

Eficode headquarters is located at Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 25. Even while it is close to various public transportation options, people might still be easily late from work. And what's worst, people's might forget to leave early as they are working on something challenging or enjoying our rooftop sauna.

The task is to help Eficodeans leave at the right time so that they would not miss any important, or why not less important, commitments.
